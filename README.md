# Course Flowchart Generator
Authored by Steven Aziz and Azhar Kimanje

## Introduction
In order for university students to graduate with a degree in a major of their choice they are required to take (and pass) a number of courses related to their major. For new university admits this can be really daunting since there is little to no informing on how they should plan their major requirements.

Fortunately, we have a solution! Our course flowchart generate will accept a file of major requirements along with the student's constraints (which quarter they started and how many credits they can take per quarter) to suggest an optimal course sequence. It works for any quarter-based university and can tell students everything they need to know about their journey in seconds!

## Description
To solve the probelm we used two third-party libraries (Toposort and vis.js) to design and execute a simple webpage that accept three inputs and prints the optimal course flow. We built the project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using VS Code and it runs in a browser environment. Two test files, `SPU_Computer_Science_BA.txt` and `SPU_Computer_Engineering_BS.txt`, are provided to verify functionality and provide a demonstration on how the course flowchart generator works.

## Requirements
- Up-to-date modern web browser (i.e. Safari, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, etc.)

All required libraries and files are included in this repository.

## User Manual
1. Clone the repository on the target computer
2. Open `index.html` in the browser (usually by right-click)

**IMPORTANT â€” all project files need to be in the same directory or the program will not run**

## Reflection
The initial difficulty we had was selecting a language we were both comfortable with and a third-party graph library to use for the flowchart. We both knew C++ and Javascript, but for some odd reason we decided we would try C++, thinking it would be easier. We quickly discovered Boost is the most-popular third-party, open-source C++ graph library. We spent well over a week trying to install and use Boost but after nearly two weeks we gave up on Boost (and, by extension, C++) in favor of JavaScript. Azhar's research led to the discovery of vis.js, a simple, easy-to-use graph visualization library for JavaScript. And so we selected vis.js as our third-party library for this project.

Creating the HTML page and CSS was easy. The next challenge: implementing HTML forms that would accept the correct information and read that information into the script file. We learned about the FileReader JavaScript class and were happy to discover reading files in the browser was very easy.

Afterwards, we spent a signifcant amount of time writing the ParseFile function to read the text file line by line and extract the information needed for the next step. We learned about JavaScript array manipulation, string methods, and objects. It was a lot of code but it wasn't anything beyond the difficulty of what we expected. All this time, Azhar had been implementing our usage of the vis.js APIs.

The most-difficult piece of the project came next: writing the algorithm to select the courses and group them into the best quarters. This part easily took over 24 hours of work before we caught a break: we would iterate through an array of quarters (where each quarter was an array of classes) while at the same time iterating through a topoloigcally sorted arary of objects and pick the best classes to go into each quarter. This idea came to Steven in an epiphany moment after many, many hours of brainstorming and pacing. It was brillian!

So we implemented the createCourseGroups function and completed the project by implementing a main function that would manage all the on-screen print and completing the HTML and graph styling.

This project was a tremendous learning experience and it makes us proud to see our work doing useful things to make potential users' lives just a little easier. If only we had this when we started university!
